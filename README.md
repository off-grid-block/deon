# DEON project

## Overview

DEON is a platform for secure and privacy-respecting decentralized data sharing among untrusted participants in off-grid networks. It enables citizens/communities to deploy their own local networks and either i) access applications and services outside the traditional Internet infrastructure or/and ii) forward Internet connectivity to the local network. DEON nodes are based on low-cost, off-the-shelf equipment (Raspberry Pi boards) and form the DEON off-grid network which offers:
* Decentralized digital identity mechanisms over blockchain, to eliminate Trusted Third Parties and Central Authorities and enable Self-Sovereign Digital Identity.
* Blockchain-enabled distributed file system to eliminate data silos.
* A marketplace of applications that leverage the blockchain layers for authentication/authorization and services based on smart contracts.

## Technical features

The DEON architecture is based on decentralized, open-source technologies:
* Hyperledger Aries/Indy for the Identity management
* Hyperledger Fabric as a general-purpose ledger for data logistics and smart contracts
* IPFS for storing our actual data
* MAZI toolkit for the network infrastructure

**Decentralized Identity Management**
The DEON decentralized identity architecture uses Verifiable Credentials, Zero-Knowledge Proofs and pairwise DIDs, enabling Self-Sovereign Identities in the network. This is accomplished by leveraging the Indy and Aries frameworks and their privacy-by-design tools. This way, all DIDs in DEON are interoperable across local applications, the public Sovrin network [1] and other Decentralized Identity systems as well, following the standards defined in W3C [2] and DIF [3].

**Private data transactions using Hyperledger Fabric**
Only pointers (hashes) of data transactions are stored on chain. They can be used by anyone in the network as evidence that a transaction is made. The actual data are served through IPFS and only authorized nodes have access to them.

**Decentralized file storage using IPFS**
Content-addressable network that combines successful protocols from other peer-to-peer systems. It enables the distribution of high volumes of data with high performance and provides deduplication.

## The Voting Use Case

One of the DEONâ€™s use cases is the Voting application which can be used for decentralized governance at the city neighborhood level or at larger scale. Self-organizing communities need to be sure that those participating in the local voting event will be properly registered, authenticated and authorized to use the platform.
